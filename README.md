# HackGT 6 Project

## Description
More Money helps you save and invest whenever you shop. The inspiration came from an observation, both from our personal experience and our friends, that sometimes we pay extra $$$ for something that is not worth it, just because we feel good for paying that extra $$$. So we though about why don't we make an app that let people keep that good feeling but also save the money for them. So we made More Money.

More Money is an android mobile app powered by NCR POS and Banking API. It shows the inventory of a merchant using NCR Silver API so that you can order on your mobile app. However, before you place an order for an item with price $X, the recommendation engine in our app will recommend you a list of similar item with a lower price, say $Y. If you decide to pick one from that list instead, you will still pay $X for that item, but have $X-Y deposited on your investment account.

## Challenge
None of us had experience in Android development so we spent one night just learning how to use Android studio and the MVC structure. The final app was developed on top of a template (https://github.com/ivacf/archi)

We had trouble accessing the Silver API, mostly because we are inexperienced in Android development and inexperienced in making API calls in Java. The connection this morning was unstable, so we ended up pulled the JSON file down and made our own local data. Thanks for all the NCR staff that helped us through!
